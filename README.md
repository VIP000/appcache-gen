Brackets appcache generator
=================

A brackets extension made to generate a simple cache manifest. 

To install, place the folder in ```brackets/src/extensions/user``` folder.

Usage
=====
Open the developer tools console, since the file contents is simply displayed in the console (for now).

Then, simply select Create App Cache form the file menu. 

You can configure files to exclude from the manifest by editing the config.json file.
